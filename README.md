# system-devops-cloud-roadmap
In this repo, I share my theoretical knowledge and hands-on experiences during my Sysytem Engineer, DevOps and Cloud roadmap.

# About me
I am a last grade computer engineering student at Marmara University. The university is mostly oriented in becoming a software engineer rather than a system engineer.

In the first period, I was focused on software engineering but I didn't like it much. As I discovered systems, networks, servers etc. I realized that I am more interested in this area.

Then, I rented my first own server and stepped into self-hosted interest. Used my own mail server, vpn server, cloud server (nextcloud) as a hobby. Indeed, I still use these self-hosted services in my daily life. I saw that these are the things that I like most.

Then, I saw that this area is much more used by companies that have their own servers (which is called on-premise). Others are using cloud providers like AWS, Azure or GCP. So I also dive into this area. I got my Azure Fundementals (AZ-900) certificate. But this is not enough. Also, realized a technology called kubernetes is on the trend and I was sure that I should also dive into DevOps world where I can both enjoy and be up-to-date with the new technologies.

Finally, I decided to broaden my career and share my theoretical and hands-on progress in this repository to make this journay to document my growth and contribute to the community.

# The Methodology

When we learn something, methodology is important. Because a full theory knowledge would lead me to nowhere. Also, a full hands-on experience without theory can prevent being proficient.

Therefore, I will use this loop for every learning subject:

Theory => Summarize => Do => Capture => Review

Let me briefly describe them. Theory: learning from docs and tutorials. Summarize: after the theory knowledge, I summarize what I learned with my own words. Do: The most important part, get hands dirty ASAP! Capture: commit my notes and hands-on to the repo. Review: short and regular review not to forget.

# The Roadmap

Here is the roadmap I will probably follow. I will not be so strict about the order to make this fun.

- Linux + Networking + Git + Bash/Python                                   ✅ (Python)

- System Engineering: On-premise system design (Virtualization, GitLab, Nexus, Local CA etc)                         ✅ (Proxmox, Nexus, Bitwarden, Wireguard)

- Docker (build/run images, Docker Compose)

- CI/CD (GitHub Actions or similar)                                        ✅ (CI/CD, CI/CD pipeline, GitHub Actions)

- Cloud basics (VMs, networking, storage, IAM)                             ✅ (Azure fundementals certificate)

- Terraform (build infra as code)

- Ansible (configure servers, deploy apps)

- Kubernetes: Local cluster → Deploy app → Helm/Kustomize, Managed K8s in cloud (EKS/AKS/GKE)

- Monitoring, logging, security basics

- 1–2 full projects combining all of the above.

I will create directories and subdirectories for each main subjects and its sub-subjects. There will be notes and hands-on products in each of them.
